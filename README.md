Created a dashboard that uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities that are searched for by user. Uses `localStorage` to store any cities that have been searched for prior and allows user to call them up quickly.  


**Live application deployed at: /**  

The following image demonstrates the application functionality:

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Research websites used to learn

In this challenge I spent some time learning the difference between AJAX and Fetch and experimented with both. Particularly the AJAX .fail function, which I really liked. I also tried to continue learning the arrow function and implementing it in my code. I had my first experience with a Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) error, which I believe I found a solution for using the cors-anywhere API link below.
